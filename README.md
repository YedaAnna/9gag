9gag image downloader script
====

This script downloads images from the specified 9gag section(default is 'Girl' section)

The user specifies the number of pages to read and the script downloads the images present on the page

Typically a page has about 8-10 images on it

The script will also rename the images to match the title of the image post

The script uses [Beautiful Soup 4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#) module

If it is not installed, you can install it by via terminal
$ pip install beautifulsoup4

Any improvements, suggestions are most welcome

P.S Script is working as of January 2015
