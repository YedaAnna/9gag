9gag image downloader script
====

This script downloads images from 9gag girl section 

The user specifies the number of pages to read and the script downloads the images present on the page

Typically a page has about 8-10 images on it

The script will also rename the images to match the title of the image post

If you want to download the images from another section just change the 'base_link' in main script 

Any improvements, suggestions are most welcome

P.S Script is working as of January 2015
